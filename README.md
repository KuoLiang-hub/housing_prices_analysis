# U.S. Housing Historical Median Price Analysis üè†üìä

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs an analysis of **U.S. housing historical median prices** using data sourced from **Zillow Research**. The analysis focuses on visualizing price trends at both the state and county levels.

The data used comes from Zillow's publicly available historical price data, specifically the **Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI)** for All Homes (SFR, Condo/Co-op) $\le$ 75th percentile.

-----

## Notebook Sections

The analysis is structured into the following three main sections within the Jupyter Notebook:

### 1\. Data Acquisition and Parsing üíæ

  * **Reads and processes** the historical median price data from two separate tables/files: one containing **state-level** data and another with **county-level** data.
  * The data is cleaned and prepared for subsequent analysis, ensuring proper date formatting and numerical integrity.

### 2\. State-Level Analysis üó∫Ô∏èüìà

  * **Year-over-Year (YoY) Price Change Map:** Visualizes the most recent YoY percentage change in median home prices for **all U.S. states** using a choropleth map. This provides a quick geographical overview of price momentum.
  * **Median Price History Line Plot:** Displays the **historical median price trend** over time for selected or all states using a line plot, allowing for comparison of long-term growth trajectories.

### 3\. New Jersey County-Level Deep Dive üìç NJ

  * **New Jersey YoY Price Change Map:** Focuses on a granular view by mapping the most recent YoY percentage change in median home prices for **all counties within New Jersey (NJ)**.
  * **New Jersey County Median Price History Line Plot:** Plots the **historical median price trend** over time for individual counties in New Jersey, enabling detailed comparison of local market performance within the state.
